Mobile game for attendees of the Open Days at the Faculty of Computer Science at AGH University of Science and Technology in Krakow.
The game allows the players to see what it is to be a student of the Faculty of Computer Science.
The players choose their career path, which they develop by completing tasks during the open day.

Each game is hidden, and access is obtained through a code.
The code is obtained by visiting specific stands during the event.
Additional games may be hidden on the premises of the Faculty (not related to any of the stands).

For a correct solution, the player receives points.
Points are represented as an hourly pay rate (because money is the best motivation to learn).
Points are compiled in an overall ranking.
At the end of the day, players receive a rank corresponding to a given hourly rate.
Players with the highest score are expected to receive a prize.
